1. Loop through each index (index is i).
    - Loop through every index after it (index is j).
        - Check if the element at index i plus the element at index j
          is equal to the target.
        - If yes, return an array of i and j.
        - If no, continue on.
2. (needed because the function is int[]) Return an empty array.
